# Contributors Guideline

Thanks a lot for any contribution!

To keep code quality high and maintenance work low, please adhere to the
following guidelines when creating a pull request:

## Style Guide

Try to write clean code and to adhere to the already used coding style.

Lines should be kept below 120 characters.

## Documentation

All new code should be properly documented (see `docs/` directory).

## Tests

If possible, new code should be covered by automated tests.

## Commit messages

Use meaningful commit messages: Please follow the advice in [this
blogpost](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
First line of your commit message should be a very short summary (ideally 50
characters or less) in the imperative mood. After the first line of the commit
message, add a blank line and then a more detailed explanation (when relevant).
